Welcome to the first CaptainDrawdown roundup — a regular digest of what's happening across the CDR landscape. Let's dive in.

## 🏭 Direct Air Capture

**Climeworks' Mammoth plant is operational in Iceland.** The world's largest DAC facility, with a nameplate capacity of 36,000 tonnes CO₂/yr, has been ramping up since mid-2024. Early operational data suggests the modular design is performing as expected, and Climeworks is already planning the next generation of larger plants. The big question remains cost — the company targets sub-$300/tonne by 2030.

**1PointFive's Texas project continues to scale.** Oxy's DAC subsidiary, using Carbon Engineering's liquid solvent technology, is building what will be the largest DAC facility in the world. When fully operational, it aims to capture up to 500,000 tonnes CO₂/yr. The project benefits from the US 45Q tax credit, which now offers $180/tonne for DAC with geological storage.

## 🪨 Enhanced Weathering

**Field trial data keeps coming in.** Multiple enhanced weathering companies — including UNDO, Lithos, and Eion — have been publishing results from multi-year agricultural deployments. The emerging consensus: basalt application rates of 20-50 tonnes/hectare can sequester 0.5-2 tonnes CO₂/hectare/year, with measurable co-benefits for soil pH and crop yields. MRV (measurement, reporting, and verification) remains the biggest challenge, but methodologies are maturing fast.

**Carbon credit demand is growing.** Enhanced weathering credits are attracting interest from corporate buyers looking for durable removal with co-benefits. Prices currently range from $80-200/tonne depending on the provider and verification methodology.

## 🌊 Ocean CDR

**Ocean alkalinity enhancement gets serious attention.** Several startups — including [Planetary](https://www.planetarytech.com/) and [Vesta](https://www.vesta.earth/) — are running pilot projects to test adding alkaline minerals to ocean waters. A 2025 review in *Nature Geoscience* concluded that OAE has "gigaton-scale potential" but needs more research on ecological impacts and monitoring frameworks.

## 📜 Policy & Markets

**EU Carbon Removal Certification Framework (CRCF) advancing.** The EU is building the regulatory infrastructure for certified carbon removals, which will be critical for creating demand and ensuring quality. The framework distinguishes between permanent removals, carbon farming, and carbon storage in products.

**Voluntary carbon market stabilizing.** After a turbulent 2023-2024 period of scrutiny and quality concerns, the voluntary market for carbon removal credits is showing signs of maturation. Buyers are increasingly sophisticated, demanding high-quality MRV and favoring durable removal methods over avoidance credits.

## 📚 Research Worth Reading

- **"Global potential of enhanced rock weathering on croplands"** — Updated modeling suggests 2-4 GtCO₂/yr potential at costs below $200/tonne, concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions
- **"Long-term stability of biochar in soil systems"** — Meta-analysis confirming biochar carbon persistence of 500+ years in most soil conditions
- **"Direct air capture cost projections: a systematic review"** — Suggests DAC could reach $100-200/tonne by 2040 with aggressive learning-by-doing and scale-up
