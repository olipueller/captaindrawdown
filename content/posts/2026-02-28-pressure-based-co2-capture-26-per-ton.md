summary: "Texas A&M researchers claim a pressure-based carbon capture system can hit $26/ton — less than half the cost of conventional amine systems. The numbers are exciting, but scale-up is everything."

Sometimes the best engineering ideas sound deceptively simple. Dissolve CO₂ in pressurized water. Reduce the pressure. Collect the gas. It's literally how a soda bottle works.

Researchers at Texas A&M University have built on this principle with a system they call Pressure Induced Carbon Capture (PICC), and their claimed cost numbers have turned heads.

## The Numbers

PICC captures and compresses up to 99% of carbon dioxide emissions for approximately $26 per metric ton of CO₂. Adding a small amount of lime to the water pushes capture to near 100% at $28 per ton — and that includes CO₂ from combustion air, not just concentrated flue gas.

For context: conventional amine-based systems, which dominate commercial carbon capture today, typically achieve around 90% capture at $50 to $100 per ton. Amines also degrade over time and require energy-intensive thermal regeneration.

If PICC's numbers hold at scale, we're talking about cutting the cost of industrial carbon capture roughly in half while improving capture rates.

## How It Works

The process cools and compresses flue gas from power plants or industrial facilities, then introduces it into an absorption column where it contacts cold water under high pressure. CO₂ dissolves — the same physical absorption that makes sparkling water fizzy. Cleaner gas exits the top.

The CO₂-rich water is then depressurized in stages, allowing the dissolved gas to bubble out for compression and permanent storage. No chemical solvents. No thermal swing. Pure physics.

## Where It Could Matter

The target applications are hard-to-abate industrial sectors: cement, steel, hydrogen production, thermal power. These industries collectively account for billions of tons of annual CO₂ emissions and have limited options for electrification.

Paired with biomass combustion, PICC could theoretically enable negative emissions — removing more CO₂ from the atmosphere than the process produces.

## The Caveat

These are lab-stage claims. The gap between demonstrated performance in a university lab and reliable operation at an industrial cement kiln or steel furnace is enormous. Scaling any carbon capture technology means dealing with real-world flue gas composition (not just clean simulations), corrosion, fouling, variable load conditions, and the thousand other problems that only appear at scale.

The cost projections also deserve scrutiny. Lab estimates routinely understate the capital expenditure, operating complexity, and energy integration challenges that emerge during commercial deployment. History is littered with capture technologies that claimed breakthrough economics and stalled at the pilot stage.

That said, the fundamental approach — physical absorption rather than chemical reaction — has real advantages in simplicity and sorbent longevity. If even part of the cost reduction survives the journey from lab to plant, PICC could meaningfully reshape the economics of industrial CCS.

Worth watching closely.
