If I could pick one CDR method that deserves more attention, it's **enhanced weathering**. It's elegant, it's scalable, and it might be the cheapest path to gigatonne-scale carbon removal. Let me explain.

## Nature's Carbon Sink (But Slow)

Rocks naturally absorb CO₂. When rain (which is slightly acidic from dissolved CO₂) falls on silicate rocks like basalt, it triggers a chemical reaction that locks carbon into stable mineral form — bicarbonates that eventually wash into the ocean and stay there for thousands of years.

This is actually one of Earth's primary long-term carbon regulation mechanisms. Over geological timescales, rock weathering has prevented runaway greenhouse effects.

The problem? It's **slow**. Natural weathering removes roughly **0.1–1.1 GtCO₂ per year** globally ([Isson et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012825225002703); [Puro.earth](https://puro.earth/enhanced-rock-weathering)). We need to remove 5–16 Gt/yr by 2050 ([IPCC AR6 WGIII, 2022](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/outreach/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Factsheet_CDR.pdf)).

## Speed It Up

Enhanced weathering (EW) is beautifully simple in concept: crush silicate rocks (usually basalt) into fine particles and spread them on land — particularly agricultural land. The increased surface area dramatically accelerates the weathering reaction.

Here's the process:
1. **Mine and crush basalt** (volcanic rock, abundant globally)
2. **Spread it on farmland** like you would lime or fertilizer
3. **Rain and soil biology do the work** — CO₂ reacts with the minerals
4. **Carbon is locked away** as dissolved bicarbonates that flow to the ocean

The whole cycle removes CO₂ from the atmosphere and stores it durably in the ocean's carbonate system.

## The Co-Benefits Are Real

This is where EW gets genuinely exciting. It's not just carbon removal — spreading basalt on farmland:

- **Raises soil pH** (counteracting acidification, similar to liming)
- **Adds essential nutrients** like calcium, magnesium, potassium, and silicon
- **Can improve crop yields** — field trials have shown yield increases of around 10–20% in some conditions, with an UNDO trial reporting 9–21% higher yields across different cultivation methods ([Kelland et al., *Frontiers in Climate*, 2024 via Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/archive/2024/03/enhancedrockweathering/); [UNDO, 2024](https://un-do.com/resources/blog/new-study-shows-the-agronomic-benefits-of-enhanced-rock-weathering/))
- **Reduces the need for synthetic lime and fertilizer** (which have their own carbon footprints)

Farmers aren't doing this as a favor to the climate. They're getting better soil and better harvests. The carbon removal is a bonus — and a potential revenue stream through carbon credits.

## Who's Doing This?

Several startups are scaling EW commercially:

- **[UNDO](https://un-do.com/)** — UK-based, working with farmers across the UK, deploying thousands of tonnes of basalt
- **[Lithos](https://lithoscarbon.com/)** — US-based, focused on corn and soy farms in the Midwest
- **[Eion](https://eion.team/)** — US-based, combining EW with advanced MRV using soil sensors
- **[InPlanet](https://www.inplanet.earth/)** — Working in tropical soils in Brazil, where weathering rates are naturally faster

And this is directly relevant to Carbon Drawdown Initiative's portfolio — CDI's [Project Carbdown](https://carbon-drawdown.de) operates the world's largest enhanced weathering field experiment, testing basalt application across real agricultural conditions.

## The Challenges

EW isn't without hurdles:

- **MRV is hard.** Measuring exactly how much CO₂ was removed by weathering reactions in complex soil systems is genuinely difficult. Multiple methodologies exist and the field is still converging on standards.
- **Logistics matter.** Mining, crushing, and transporting millions of tonnes of rock requires serious supply chain infrastructure.
- **Regional variation.** Weathering rates depend on climate, soil type, rainfall, and temperature. Tropical regions are generally faster; cold, dry regions are slower.

## The Potential

A landmark 2020 modeling study in *Nature* by Beerling et al. estimated global EW potential at **2–4 GtCO₂/yr** on existing cropland, at costs of US$80–180/tonne ([Beerling et al., *Nature*, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2448-9)). That's a meaningful chunk of the removal we need, at a competitive price, with agricultural co-benefits built in.

Enhanced weathering isn't a silver bullet. Nothing is. But it might be the most underappreciated tool in the CDR toolbox. 🪨
