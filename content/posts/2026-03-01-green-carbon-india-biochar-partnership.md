The geography of carbon removal is shifting. Japan's Green Carbon Inc. has partnered with India's Excellent Enfab Incorporation to build an industrial-scale biochar carbon removal plant in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Commercial operations are planned for Q2 2026.

## The Partnership

Green Carbon, headquartered in Japan, has built a diverse CDR portfolio spanning rice paddy credits, biochar, forest conservation, carbon farming, mangrove planting, and cattle methane reduction across Japan, Southeast Asia, Australia, and South America.

The India partnership represents their push into industrial-scale biochar production. Excellent Enfab, based in Ahmedabad, brings local manufacturing expertise and supply chain access.

## Why India

India offers three things that make biochar CDR compelling:

1. **Massive agricultural biomass supply:** India generates over 500 million tonnes of crop residue annually, much of which is burned in the open — causing severe air pollution
2. **Growing carbon market:** India plans to launch its first carbon trading programme by October 2026, creating domestic demand for high-quality removal credits
3. **Manufacturing capacity:** India's industrial base can produce biochar equipment and facilities at competitive costs

Converting agricultural waste that would otherwise be burned into permanent carbon storage is about as clean a win-win as CDR gets.

## Asia's Biochar Build-Out

This isn't happening in isolation. Green Carbon also recently signed an MOU with Naresuan University in Thailand for agricultural carbon credit research. CDI portfolio company [Happy Ground](https://www.carbon-drawdown.de/blog/2025-9-10-portfolio-spotlight-happy-ground-biochar-in-thailand) is producing biochar in Thailand. And the SAWA x GreenJump franchise model is expanding biochar production across Southeast Asia.

Asia has the agricultural waste feedstock, the manufacturing capacity, and the growing carbon markets to become the center of global biochar CDR. It's happening now.

## The Scale Question

Biochar currently provides over 90% of commercially traded permanent CDR credits. Global production reached at least 350,000 tonnes in 2023. With facilities like the Ahmedabad plant coming online, Asia could dramatically increase that number.

CDI's recent article on [biochar at different scales](https://www.carbon-drawdown.de/blog/2026-2-9-how-to-make-biochar-at-different-scales-large-and-small-ft-cotierra-amp-syncraft) makes the key point: climate solutions need multiple blueprints. Industrial-scale plants in India and community-scale producers in Latin America are complementary, not competing.
