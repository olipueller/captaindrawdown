There's always been an uncomfortable question hanging over Direct Air Capture: what powers it?

DAC plants need enormous amounts of energy to pull CO₂ from the air. If that energy comes from fossil fuels, the math gets awkward fast — you're burning carbon to capture carbon. Critics have rightly pointed out that this makes some DAC projects little more than expensive greenwashing.

That argument just got a lot harder to make for Occidental's STRATOS facility.

## 500MW of Dedicated Solar

[Origis Energy has fully commissioned](https://constructionreviewonline.com/500mwdc-swift-air-solar-complex-project-in-texas-brought-online-by-origis-energy/) the 500 MWdc Swift Air Solar complex in West Texas — three solar facilities totaling 500MW spread across Ector County. The project represents over [$650 million in infrastructure investment](https://constructionreviewonline.com/500mwdc-swift-air-solar-complex-project-in-texas-brought-online-by-origis-energy/) and was fully planned, developed, and constructed by Origis Energy.

The key detail: this isn't grid solar that STRATOS happens to draw from. It's **dedicated renewable power** built specifically for Occidental's operations in the Permian Basin, including the STRATOS DAC facility. The solar complex went online in February 2026, meaning STRATOS now has a direct line to clean electricity.

## Why This Matters

STRATOS, operated by Occidental's subsidiary [1PointFive](https://www.1pointfive.com/projects/ector-county-tx), is designed to be the world's largest Direct Air Capture plant. While Climeworks' facilities in Iceland currently lead in operational capacity, STRATOS represents a hundred-fold increase in scale.

The commissioning of Swift Air Solar means:

- **The energy lifecycle argument is addressed.** Clean power in, CO₂ removal out. The net carbon math works.
- **A model for future DAC deployment.** Pairing utility-scale renewables directly with carbon removal infrastructure could become the standard approach.
- **Texas as a CDR hub.** The Permian Basin — historically synonymous with oil extraction — is becoming a testbed for carbon removal technology. The irony is not lost on anyone.

## The Financing Stack

The project was backed by a $415 million financing package: [$290 million in debt arranged by Natixis CIB](https://constructionreviewonline.com/500mwdc-swift-air-solar-complex-project-in-texas-brought-online-by-origis-energy/) and $125 million in tax equity from Advantage Capital. The fact that mainstream financial institutions are backing dedicated renewable-to-DAC infrastructure is a signal that the market sees a viable business model here.

## The Bigger Picture

Saudi Arabia is also moving on DAC — [Climeworks recently signed an MoU with the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu](https://www.zawya.com/en/projects/industry/saudi-arabia-explores-direct-air-capture-project-in-jubail-of8u21xr) to study building a DAC project in Jubail Industrial City, following a successful testing unit in Riyadh that evaluated performance in hot, arid conditions.

Meanwhile, [EnergyX announced](https://batteriesnews.com/energyx-commercializes-cleantech-materials-manufacturing-for-us-lithium-supply-chain-and-direct-air-carbon-capture/) that its advanced materials manufacturing is now operational in Austin, TX — producing roll-to-roll membranes that could reduce DAC costs by improving sorbent technology.

The DAC sector is evolving from "interesting science experiment" to "industrial infrastructure with its own power supply." That's a phase change worth paying attention to.

DAC powered by fossil fuels never made sense. Solar-powered DAC does. This is how it should work.
