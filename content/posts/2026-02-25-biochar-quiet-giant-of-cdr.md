Quick: which carbon removal method dominates the commercial credit market?

If you guessed Direct Air Capture or Enhanced Rock Weathering, you'd be wrong. The answer is biochar — and it's not even close.

## The Numbers

According to a [new market report profiling 148 companies](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/02/23/3242368/28124/en/Biochar-Market-Research-Report-2026-2036-Profiles-of-148-Companies-Spanning-Producers-Equipment-Manufacturers-Technology-Developers-and-Carbon-Credit-Platforms.html), biochar delivers **over 90% of all commercially traded permanent carbon dioxide removal credits**. Global production reached at least 350,000 tonnes in 2023, and the market has been growing steadily since.

The [global biochar market](https://www.inkwoodresearch.com/reports/global-bichar-market-size/) is valued at **$838 million in 2026** and projected to reach $2.3 billion by 2034, growing at a compound annual rate of 13.4%. In North America alone, the [market stands at $388 million](https://www.inkwoodresearch.com/reports/north-america-biochar-market-size/) and is on track for nearly $1 billion by 2034.

Carbon removal credit pricing has [stabilized at approximately $150 per tonne of CO₂e](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/02/23/3242368/28124/en/Biochar-Market-Research-Report-2026-2036-Profiles-of-148-Companies-Spanning-Producers-Equipment-Manufacturers-Technology-Developers-and-Carbon-Credit-Platforms.html) — a price point that works for both producers and corporate buyers. Multi-year offtake agreements are becoming standard, giving producers the revenue certainty they need to scale.

## Why Biochar Works (Commercially)

Biochar has several advantages that explain its market dominance:

**Simplicity.** The process is well-understood: heat biomass in a low-oxygen environment (pyrolysis), and you get a stable carbon-rich material. No exotic chemistry, no frontier engineering.

**Durability.** Biochar can lock carbon away for hundreds to thousands of years when incorporated into soil. That "permanence" is what buyers want when they're paying $150/tonne.

**Co-benefits.** Biochar improves soil health, reduces the need for fertilizers, enhances water retention, and can even [filter contaminants from water](https://www.inkwoodresearch.com/reports/united-states-biochar-market-size/). These agricultural and environmental benefits create value beyond just the carbon credit.

**Feedstock availability.** Biomass waste — agricultural residues, forestry leftovers, dead trees — is abundant. A [new biochar project in California's Sequoia National Forest](https://www.recorderonline.com/gallery/major-funding-for-tribe-water-biochar-projects/article_787b4c65-a16d-4d52-b434-5b62e2b4e890.html) will convert dead and dying trees into biochar, projecting removal of up to 10,600 metric tonnes of CO₂ annually.

## Going Global

The growth story isn't just North American. [China's biochar market](https://www.inkwoodresearch.com/china-biochar-market-the-agricultural-waste-revolution/) is transforming agricultural waste into an environmental solution — growing from $73 million in 2026 to nearly $242 million by 2034 at a 16% CAGR. Rice straw, previously burned illegally, now fuels biochar production.

In Africa, [Varaha just launched its Industrial Partners Program (VIPP)](https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/varaha-launches-varaha-industrial-partners-program-vipp-to-scale-industrial-biochar-carbon-removal-in-cote-divoire-302692188.html) in Côte d'Ivoire, enabling biomass processing facilities to generate high-integrity carbon removal credits. This model — plugging biochar into existing industrial infrastructure in the Global South — could dramatically accelerate deployment.

## The Verification Revolution

The market is maturing beyond simple carbon accounting. New verification approaches include [blockchain tracking, IoT monitoring, and integration with climate finance mechanisms](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/02/23/3242368/28124/en/Biochar-Market-Research-Report-2026-2036-Profiles-of-148-Companies-Spanning-Producers-Equipment-Manufacturers-Technology-Developers-and-Carbon-Credit-Platforms.html) like green bonds and blended finance. The evolution from traditional carbon offsets to high-integrity permanent removal credits is pushing biochar into premium pricing territory.

## What It Means for CDR

Biochar's market dominance tells us something important about what works in carbon removal: proven technology, clear permanence, tangible co-benefits, and available feedstock. It's not the flashiest CDR method — no giant machines, no ocean engineering — but it's the one that's actually delivering credits at scale.

The quiet giant of CDR is growing fast. And the rest of the industry should be paying attention.
