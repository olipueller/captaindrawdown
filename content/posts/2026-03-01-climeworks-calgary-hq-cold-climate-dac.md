Climeworks, one of the Carbon Drawdown Initiative's [portfolio companies](https://www.carbon-drawdown.de/blog/2025-8-4-portfolio-spotlight-climeworks), has established new headquarters in Calgary, Alberta.

## Why Calgary

Alberta offers something few other jurisdictions can match: deep expertise in carbon management, established subsurface storage infrastructure, and a supportive regulatory environment for carbon capture projects. Calgary's Energy Transition Centre (ETC) — where Climeworks is setting up — brings startups, researchers, investors, and industry leaders under one roof.

It's a deliberate choice. Alberta has decades of experience managing CO₂ underground, originally for enhanced oil recovery but increasingly for permanent geological storage.

## The Test Plan

A mobile DAC test facility will launch in Calgary by fall 2026, collecting real-time performance data in cold-climate conditions. This builds on Climeworks' extensive operational experience in Iceland (where temperatures regularly drop below -10°C) and extends their dataset to Canadian winter conditions.

The key question: how do DAC systems perform across different temperature extremes? Climeworks is methodically answering this by testing in:

- **Cold climates:** Iceland and now Alberta
- **Hot, arid climates:** KAPSARC hub in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

This multi-climate testing strategy is critical. DAC can't be a solution that only works in Iceland. It needs to perform reliably across geographies and seasons.

## The Saudi Connection

Climeworks simultaneously announced a strengthened partnership with the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu (RCJY) to advance large-scale DAC in Saudi Arabia. This isn't just about testing — it's about building the commercial pipeline for DAC deployment in the Middle East.

## CDI's Perspective

CDI invested in Climeworks because they represent the frontier of commercially viable direct air capture. As CDI's [portfolio spotlight](https://www.carbon-drawdown.de/blog/2025-8-4-portfolio-spotlight-climeworks) noted, Climeworks' systematic approach to scaling — from prototype to Orca to Mammoth — shows how CDR companies should mature.

The Calgary expansion continues that trajectory. More data, more climate zones, more confidence in the technology before scaling to megatonne capacity.
