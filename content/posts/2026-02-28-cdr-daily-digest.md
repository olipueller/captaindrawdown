# CDR Daily Digest — 28 Feb 2026

## 🔑 Top Story: Microsoft *Is* the Carbon Removal Market

A striking new finding from [BloombergNEF and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy](https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/microsoft-is-the-carbon-removal-market/): Microsoft purchased **93% of all carbon removal credits globally** in 2025. It's the first year the organizations tracked CDR demand specifically.

The numbers paint a picture of a market that's growing fast but dangerously concentrated:

- Global CDR demand **doubled** between 2024 and 2025 to **57 million metric tons** of CO₂
- Reforestation projects account for 56% of total volume
- Nature-based credits average **$7–20/ton**; tech-based CDR exceeds **$500/ton** ([Sylvera](https://www.sylvera.com/blog/carbon-offset-price))
- Microsoft's emissions grew ~30% between 2020–2024, largely due to AI data center buildout

The takeaway: the industry urgently needs more anchor buyers — and government procurement programs — to diversify beyond a single corporate champion.

## 🌊 Science: Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement Clears a Major Hurdle

A team from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution just reported results from the **first-ever ship-based ocean alkalinity enhancement experiment**. In August 2025, they poured 65,000 litres of sodium hydroxide into the Gulf of Maine.

The [results](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2517171-ocean-geoengineering-trial-finds-no-evidence-of-harm-to-marine-life/), announced at the Ocean Sciences Meeting in Glasgow:

- **2–10 tonnes of CO₂ removed** in the first four days; up to 50 tonnes estimated total
- **No significant impact on marine life** — plankton, fish larvae, lobster larvae all unaffected
- Carbon stored as bicarbonate ions with durability in the **tens of thousands of years**

One important caveat: lifecycle emissions from manufacturing and transporting the sodium hydroxide haven't been calculated yet. Net removal still needs to be proven.

Also in marine CDR: a [new study in *Communications Sustainability*](https://www.azocleantech.com/news.aspx?newsID=36190) mapped optimal US coastal sites for electrochemical marine carbon removal, ranking Texas/Louisiana highest for affordability and California for raw removal capacity.

## 💰 Market Moves

**LEGO Group invests another $2.8M in CDR**, bringing total commitments to $8.5M. The [new investments](https://carbonherald.com/the-lego-group-invests-new-2-8m-in-cdr-projects/) span four projects with Climate Impact Partners and ClimeFi — covering reforestation in Mexico, biomass geological storage, carbon mineralization, and marine CDR via wastewater alkalinity enhancement.

**Supercritical** transacted 63,296 CO₂ Removal Certificates via Puro.earth in 2025 — the [largest marketplace volumes for a second consecutive year](https://carbonherald.com/supercritical-transacts-the-largest-volumes-of-puro-earth-delivered-cdr-credits-for-a-second-year-in-a-row/). Key trend: buyers are pivoting from long-term catalytic commitments to near-term verified delivery.

**Air Liquide and Holcim** [signed an agreement](https://esgnews.com/air-liquide-holcim-target-1-1-million-tons-of-annual-co%E2%82%82-capture-at-belgium-cement-plant/) to deploy carbon capture at Holcim's Obourg cement plant in Belgium — targeting **1.1 million tons of CO₂/year**. Captured emissions would flow via Antwerp@C to permanent North Sea storage. FID still pending regulatory and public financing support.

**Abatable and Space Intelligence** [partnered](https://carbonherald.com/abatable-space-intelligence-team-up-to-tackle-scope-3-emissions/) to improve Scope 3 emissions reporting, combining supply-shed mapping with geospatial datasets. They claim 60%+ more accuracy vs. default IPCC methodologies.

## 📋 Policy & Regulation

**California moves ahead on climate disclosure.** CARB approved the first implementing regulation for [SB 253](https://www.ecotextile.com/2026022761884/news/legislation/california-sets-2026-climate-disclosure-deadline/) (Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act), setting 2026 compliance deadlines for large companies — even as federal climate reporting faces rollbacks.

**US EPA extends GHG reporting deadline** from March 31 to [June 10, 2026](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2026/02/27/2026-03995/extending-the-reporting-deadline-under-the-greenhouse-gas-reporting-rule-for-2025), part of broader reconsideration of reporting obligations under the current administration.

**Europe's CCUS financing gap widens.** A new [CCSA/Deloitte analysis](https://carbonherald.com/ccsa-warns-ccus-delays-eu/) warns that fragmented rules, unclear storage liability, and slow permitting are freezing capital. Without rapid coordination, developers may redirect CCUS investment to faster-moving jurisdictions.

**Atlantic Council calls for global carbon accounting standard.** A new [issue brief](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/standardizing-carbon-accounting-worldwide-with-a-single-robust-cost-effective-system/) argues that Climate Club nations should select a single carbon footprint methodology to unlock climate finance at scale.

## 🔬 Research Corner

**$26/ton carbon capture?** Texas A&M researchers developed [Pressure Induced Carbon Capture (PICC)](https://solarquarter.com/2026/02/27/pressure-based-co%E2%82%82-capture-system-advances-industrial-decarbonisation/) — using water and pressure changes instead of chemical solvents. Claims: 99% capture at $26/ton, compared to $50–100/ton for conventional amine-based systems. Still needs large-scale validation, but potentially transformative for cement, steel, and industrial sectors.

## 📊 Market Tone

**Growing but fragile.** CDR demand doubled in a year — that's real momentum. But 93% buyer concentration is a systemic risk. Europe wants CCUS but can't get projects financed. The OAE trial and low-cost capture research offer long-term hope. California provides a regulatory floor as federal oversight retreats. The next 12 months will tell us whether this market can graduate from one-buyer dependency to genuine multi-stakeholder demand.
