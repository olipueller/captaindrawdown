Germany is building Direct Air Capture infrastructure. DACMA GmbH just broke ground on a new DAC competence center in the Port of Hamburg — and simultaneously announced a landmark order from Canadian project developer Deep Sky.

## The Facility

The DACMA Competence Center will serve as a research, development, and testing platform for modular DAC plants. The center will:

- Improve technical components for CO₂ capture from ambient air
- Optimize operating processes for efficiency
- Advance new research topics with international universities
- Test Generation 2 DAC technology before international deployment

Hamburg's Senator for Economics, Dr. Melanie Leonhard, framed it in economic terms: "We are extracting carbon dioxide directly from the air and turning it into an opportunity for industry, value creation, and climate protection."

## The Deep Sky Order

The real headline is the commercial order. Canadian project developer Deep Sky will deploy DACMA's technology in a facility that starts at 30,000 tonnes of CO₂ per year and scales to 1,000,000 tonnes.

That's a significant capacity target. For context, Climeworks' Mammoth plant in Iceland — currently the world's largest operational DAC facility — captures 36,000 tonnes per year. Deep Sky is planning nearly 30x that.

## The eFuel Connection

DACMA is closely connected to eFuel DAC GmbH, which uses captured CO₂ as feedstock for climate-neutral synthetic fuels. CEO Hanspeter Tiede noted: "By capturing CO₂ directly from the air, we are laying the foundation for climate-neutral fuels."

The Griesemann Gruppe, a major German industrial plant builder, also just became a co-shareholder of eFuel GmbH — signaling growing industrial confidence in DAC-to-fuel pathways.

## Why Hamburg

The Port of Hamburg gives DACMA access to industrial infrastructure, shipping logistics, and a hub of engineering talent. It's a smart location choice: CDR technology needs to integrate with existing industrial systems, not exist in isolation.

This is a pattern worth watching. [CDI's research on CDR scaling](https://www.carbon-drawdown.de/blog/2026-2-24-cdr-must-shift-from-speed-amp-scale-to-prove-amp-learn) has emphasized that the field needs to "prove and learn" before rushing to gigatonne scale — and competence centers like DACMA are exactly where that learning happens.
