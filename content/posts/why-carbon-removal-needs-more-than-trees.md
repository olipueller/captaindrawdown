Let me be clear upfront: trees are wonderful. Plant them. Protect them. Love them. But if your entire carbon removal strategy is "plant more trees," we have a problem.

## The Scale Problem

Humanity emits roughly **37 billion tonnes of CO₂ per year**. The IPCC says we need to remove **6–16 billion tonnes per year by 2050** on top of aggressive emissions cuts. Afforestation and reforestation can contribute meaningfully — estimates range from 0.5 to 3.6 GtCO₂/yr — but they can't do it alone.

Here's why:

**Land competition.** Growing enough trees to remove billions of tonnes of CO₂ requires *enormous* amounts of land — land that's also needed for food production, biodiversity, and, well, the people who already live there. A 2024 study in *Nature* estimated that realistic afforestation potential is closer to 1 GtCO₂/yr without displacing agriculture or communities.

**Permanence.** Trees burn. They die. They decompose. A forest planted today could release its stored carbon back into the atmosphere in a wildfire decades from now. The 2023 Canadian wildfire season released an estimated 480 Mt CO₂ — roughly equivalent to India's annual fossil fuel emissions. That's not a theoretical risk; it's already happening.

**Saturation.** Trees don't grow forever. A mature forest reaches a rough carbon equilibrium where new growth roughly equals decay. The big sequestration happens during the growth phase, then tapers off.

## The Portfolio Approach

This is why the CDR field talks about a **portfolio** of removal methods:

- **Enhanced weathering (EW):** Spreading crushed silicate rocks on agricultural land to accelerate natural CO₂-absorbing chemical reactions. Added benefit: it can improve soil health and crop yields. Companies like [UNDO](https://un-do.com/) and [Lithos](https://lithoscarbon.com/) are scaling this now.

- **Direct air capture (DAC):** Giant machines that chemically scrub CO₂ from ambient air. Energy-intensive and expensive today (~$400–600/tonne), but costs are falling and permanence is essentially guaranteed when combined with geological storage. [Climeworks](https://climeworks.com/) and [1PointFive](https://www.1pointfive.com/) are leading the charge.

- **Biochar:** Heating biomass in low-oxygen conditions creates a stable carbon-rich material that can persist in soil for hundreds to thousands of years. It also improves soil fertility. Win-win.

- **Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE):** Adding alkaline minerals to the ocean to increase its capacity to absorb CO₂. The ocean already absorbs about a quarter of our emissions — OAE helps it do more.

- **Biomass carbon removal and storage (BiCRS):** Burning or gasifying biomass for energy while capturing and storing the CO₂. If the biomass is sustainably sourced, the net effect is carbon removal.

## Why This Matters

No single method can scale to the gigatonnes we need. Each has trade-offs in cost, permanence, land use, energy requirements, and co-benefits. The smart bet is diversification — just like an investment portfolio.

Trees are a critical piece. But they're one piece. The CDR community is building the rest, and the pace of innovation is genuinely exciting.

I'll be tracking all of it. Stay tuned. 🌍
