Let me be clear upfront: trees are wonderful. Plant them. Protect them. Love them. But if your entire carbon removal strategy is "plant more trees," we have a problem.

## The Scale Problem

Humanity emits roughly **37.4 billion tonnes of CO₂ per year** from fossil fuels ([Global Carbon Budget, 2024](https://globalcarbonbudget.org/fossil-fuel-co2-emissions-increase-again-in-2024/)). The IPCC says we need to remove **5–16 billion tonnes per year by 2050** on top of aggressive emissions cuts ([IPCC AR6 WGIII, 2022](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/outreach/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Factsheet_CDR.pdf)). Afforestation and reforestation can contribute meaningfully — the IPCC estimates a technical potential of **0.5–10.1 GtCO₂/yr** by 2050, with median estimates around 3.9 GtCO₂/yr ([IPCC AR6 WGIII, Ch. 7](https://www.wri.org/insights/how-effective-land-removing-carbon-pollution-ipcc-weighs)) — but they can't do it alone.

Here's why:

**Land competition.** Growing enough trees to remove billions of tonnes of CO₂ requires *enormous* amounts of land — land that's also needed for food production, biodiversity, and, well, the people who already live there. A 2024 study in *Nature Climate Change* found that when accounting for implementation costs and land-use competition, realistic reforestation potential is significantly constrained ([Mo et al., *Nature Climate Change*, 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02068-1)). A separate analysis limiting negative impacts on biodiversity and food security put the maximum at about 3.8 GtCO₂/yr by 2050 ([Deprez et al., via *npj Climate Action*, 2026](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44168-026-00335-9)).

**Permanence.** Trees burn. They die. They decompose. A forest planted today could release its stored carbon back into the atmosphere in a wildfire decades from now. The 2023 Canadian wildfire season released an estimated 480 megatonnes of carbon — equivalent to roughly 1,760 Mt CO₂ — making it the fourth-largest emitter globally that year, behind only China, the US, and India ([Copernicus/CAMS, 2023](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/2023-year-intense-global-wildfire-activity); [Walker et al., *Nature*, 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07878-z)). That's not a theoretical risk; it's already happening.

**Saturation.** Trees don't grow forever. A mature forest reaches a rough carbon equilibrium where new growth roughly equals decay. The big sequestration happens during the growth phase, then tapers off.

## The Portfolio Approach

This is why the CDR field talks about a **portfolio** of removal methods:

- **Enhanced weathering (EW):** Spreading crushed silicate rocks on agricultural land to accelerate natural CO₂-absorbing chemical reactions. Added benefit: it can improve soil health and crop yields ([Beerling et al., *Nature*, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2448-9)). Companies like [UNDO](https://un-do.com/) and [Lithos](https://lithoscarbon.com/) are scaling this now.

- **Direct air capture (DAC):** Giant machines that chemically scrub CO₂ from ambient air. Energy-intensive and expensive today (~$400–1,000/tonne), but costs are falling and permanence is essentially guaranteed when combined with geological storage ([WRI, 2024](https://www.wri.org/insights/direct-air-capture-resource-considerations-and-costs-carbon-removal)). [Climeworks](https://climeworks.com/) and [1PointFive](https://www.1pointfive.com/) are leading the charge.

- **Biochar:** Heating biomass in low-oxygen conditions creates a stable carbon-rich material that can persist in soil for hundreds to thousands of years ([Frontiers in Soil Science, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/soil-science/articles/10.3389/fsoil.2024.1376159/full)). It also improves soil fertility. Win-win.

- **Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE):** Adding alkaline minerals to the ocean to increase its capacity to absorb CO₂. The ocean already absorbs about 25–30% of our emissions ([NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/ocean-coasts/ocean-acidification); [Global Carbon Project via Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-the-oceans-are-absorbing-more-carbon-than-previously-thought/)) — OAE helps it do more.

- **Biomass carbon removal and storage (BiCRS):** Burning or gasifying biomass for energy while capturing and storing the CO₂. If the biomass is sustainably sourced, the net effect is carbon removal.

## Why This Matters

No single method can scale to the gigatonnes we need. Each has trade-offs in cost, permanence, land use, energy requirements, and co-benefits. The smart bet is diversification — just like an investment portfolio.

Trees are a critical piece. But they're one piece. The CDR community is building the rest, and the pace of innovation is genuinely exciting.

I'll be tracking all of it. Stay tuned. 🌍
