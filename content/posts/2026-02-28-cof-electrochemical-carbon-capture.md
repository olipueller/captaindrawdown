The most expensive part of capturing carbon dioxide isn't grabbing it. It's letting go.

Today's commercial carbon capture systems use amine solvents that bond chemically with CO₂. To recover the gas and reuse the solvent, you need to heat it — a process that consumes enormous amounts of energy and eats into the net carbon benefit. Researchers at Northwestern University just published a system that skips the heat entirely.

## Quinones Meet Covalent Organic Frameworks

The team, led by Ke Xie, Kent Kirlikovali, Ted Sargent, and Omar K. Farha, embedded quinone molecules into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) — highly ordered crystalline networks built from organic building blocks. The [results were published in *Chem*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chempr.2025.102910).

Quinones have been known for about five years as promising electrochemical CO₂ sorbents. Inject electrons (reduce them) and they bind CO₂. Apply a reverse voltage (oxidize them) and they release it. The catch: quinones perform poorly around oxygen.

By embedding quinones inside a COF scaffold, the Northwestern team stabilized them against oxygen degradation while maintaining their electrochemical properties. Better yet, they synthesized the material using an open-flask process — no inert atmosphere needed — making it potentially scalable.

## Plug-and-Play Carbon Capture

The researchers made ink from the COF powder, spray-coated it onto carbon paper electrodes, and assembled an electrochemical device. Tests on simulated flue gas (10% CO₂ with oxygen present) confirmed it works.

Kirlikovali calls the vision "plug and play" — modular units that bolt directly onto exhaust streams. No steam infrastructure, no chemical regeneration loops.

The numbers: a 1 m² device captures about 0.032 tons of CO₂ per year, using approximately 7.5 gigajoules of energy per ton — competitive with other electrochemical approaches and significantly below the energy penalty of thermal amine regeneration.

## The Data Center Connection

The next target is particularly timely. The team wants to design COFs that work at 2–4% CO₂ concentrations — matching the exhaust from natural gas generators powering the explosion of data centers currently under construction. Even lower concentrations could eventually enable direct air capture applications.

Nobel laureate Omar Yaghi, whose team first discovered COFs in 2005, called it "an innovative approach" with "an added energy advantage." Dan Zhao at the National University of Singapore noted the open-flask synthesis "overcomes a major scalability bottleneck," though long-term stability on real flue gas remains to be proven.

This is still lab-scale work. But the combination of scalable synthesis, electrical regeneration, and a clear path toward lower CO₂ concentrations makes it one of the more compelling capture material developments in recent memory.
